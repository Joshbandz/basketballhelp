        <h2 style="text-align:center;color:white;font-size:200%">Shooting Tips</h2>
        <p style="text-align:center;color:white;font-size:200%">If you want to.Become a great shooter at the 3 like: ray allen, steph curry, or melo, Here are some Tips...
~Balance: "Keep your feet shoulder-width apart with your dominant foot just slightly ahead of your other, maybe six inches. Bend your knees for a good foundation.”
~Eyes: “Keep your focus on the front of the rim. Lock your eyes on that target and try to put the ball just over those hooks, instead of aiming at the back of the rim.
~Elbow: “Keep your elbows bent and your upper arm perpendicular to the basket and parallel to the ground so that it's stacked and not just hanging out like a chicken wing.”
~Follow-Through: You always have to follow through every shot. It helps you shoot with a better arch and it helps you get a better rotation on the ball.</p>
 
 <h3 style="text-align:center;color:white;font-size:200%">Passing Tips</h3>
  <p style="text-align:center;color:white;font-size:200%">~Pass with two hands. By putting both hands on the ball you have more control and can easily put backspin on the ball.
~Step into your pass. Put your weight into your pass to ensure proper velocity and control.
~Always follow through. Just like a good shooter, a good passer will follow through.
~Make the pass easy to catch. Don’t put a lot of speed on the pass if you don’t need it, and always read the body language of your teammate, are they ready for a pass? Where are their hands?
~Pass away from the defender. Agressive defenders will play passing lanes and knock away passes. Passing to the side of your teammate that is away from the defender will reduce tipped passes.</p>

<h4 style="text-align:center;color:white;font-size:200%">Defensive Tips</h4> 
<p style="text-align:center;color:white;font-size:200%">~Never lose your balance: Stay on your feet and do NOT go for shot fakes. When you go for fakes, you are beat! Do not lunge for the ball and get off balance. Stay in a WIDE stance. If your feet get too close together, you will lose balance. Stay in a LOW and athletic stance. If you stand upright, you will more easily lose balance. Take short steps when sliding. If your feet come too close together, you will lose balance.
~If the ball is below the mid-section, put your hand above the ball.This prevents the offensive player from putting it in shooting position.
~If the ball is above the head, place your hands under the ball and flip up.This keeps you out of foul trouble (because most refs only call fouls if you swing downward) and it also keeps the player from bringing the ball down to shooting position.
~Keep your head lower than the offensive player's head.That way you're getting underneath the offensive player and will be in good position to slide your feet or take a charge.</p>
 
 <h5 style="text-align:center;color:white;font-size:200%">Rebounding Tips</h5>
 <p style="text-align:center;color:white;font-size:200%">~Don’t watch the ball in flight on a shot. It is more important to be on your way into position under the basket. Once you get position than concentrate on the ball.
~Always seek inside position so you can block or check out your opponents. Deny him the ball. Boxing out is almost extinct and is a surefire way to infuriate your opponent.
~Good balance and strength will serve you well. You want to be low in some cases even squatting so you have more lift when jumping. In basketball the lower man is the quicker man. Standing straight up will get you no where.
~When you block out on rebounds, avoid moving too far under the goal. You can not allow your man to push you out of the play. Be more aggressive than him.
~Learn to use “spread eagle” coming off the board with the ball. Spread your elbows, using your body to ward off the opponents. The only way your man can get the ball from you than would be to foul.</p>
 
 <h6 style="text-align:center;color:white;font-size:200%">Dribbling Tips</h6>
  <p style="text-align:center;color:white;font-size:200%">~Head up, don’t look at the ball. You can’t afford to be looking down in a game, so don’t do it when you practice.
~Knees bent, back straight. The lower you are the safer the ball, practice as low as you can.
~Use your free hand to fend off defenders. Don’t forget that you are allowed to smack defenders away when they try to reach in, practice this when doing dribbling drills.
~Keep the ball on your finger tips. Good ball handlers control the ball with their fingertips, no palms.
~Increase your speed! Practice fast enough that you lose control, this will prepare you for game speed.</p>
